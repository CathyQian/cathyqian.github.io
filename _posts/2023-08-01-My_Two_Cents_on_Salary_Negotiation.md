I have changed a couple of jobs in the past five years and thus accumulated a decent amount of experience negotiating compensations with recruiters about compensations. I am pretty sure you can easily find abundant tutorials online teaching you how to negotiate salary or compensation. Here I would like to share some personal experience and thoughts about it both from a strategical and tactical perspective. 

### Strategical 
- Salary negotiation is expected by employers. If you are a female from an Asian country, you may tend to just accept whatever amount they offer you and show tremondous appreciation to your recruiter or hiring manager for saving you from unemployment. However, this is not how Coporate America works. Corporate America runs in a free capitalism market and most employment are at will. If they are planning to give you an offer, the two sides should sit together, negotiate the terms, and close a deal at the maximum benefit of both parties.
- Salary negotiation won't cost you your offer. They have already spent lots of time and thousands of dollars recruiting you which includes searching for you, reviewing your resume, interviewing you, chatting/emailing you and negotiating with you about compensation. That's already a huge sunk cost and they won't walk away easily.
- You need to know your bargin power. If you have a counter offer, that's great. If you don't, that's OK. Ask yourself are you willing to walk away from the offer even if it's your dream opportunity? When I was a young child, my mom would buy us new clothes in small shops in our rural town around new year. However, those small shops never put clear prices tags on the items they sell. Instead, they would offer a high starting price, and expect you to negotiate with them. My mom, haven't taken any classes about negotiation, have always used a very simple strategy to win over the seller. She would first show interest to the item, exam it carefully and point out flaws of it, offer a much lower price and told the seller that she would go to the store nextdoor if he or she didn't accept the price she asked. In most cases, they would meet some price in the middle and make deals. Occasionally, the seller didn't want to yield, so my mom would simply take me to another store for clothes.

### Tactical
- Do your homework to know your market price. If you work in the high-tech industry, levels.fyi is a great place to get an idea of the compensation of recent hires.
- Show sincere interest to the role and your willingness to join if a mutual agreement on compensation is reached. That lays a solid foundation of the ongoing negotiation.
- Show your concern beyond money. This will provide some room for you to walk away from the offer. 
- Ask the recruiter to come up with the first numbers. Never tell them your numbers first.
- Tell them that you need some time to work on the numbers. Give yourself a couple of days to think through it. Time has huge powers in business negotiation. The recruiters and hiring managers are also afraid that you will get better offers over time.
- Distinguish the negotiable and non-negotiable, the official and non-official numbers. Anything that will be included in the final offer letter is expected to be negotiable, while negotiating items that won't be written down is useless. It's usually challenging to negotiate base salary, while sign-on bonus and RSU/equity have much wiggle room to adjustment. Paid time off may or may not be negotiable, depending on the company.
- Come back with your highest numbers and tell them you will accept the offer if they try their best to get as close as possible. This shows your genuity and also give both sides some room if your numbers happens to be out of their expected range. Don't worry though, as they can always come back and say sorry we can't give you that much, but here is the best thing we can do.
