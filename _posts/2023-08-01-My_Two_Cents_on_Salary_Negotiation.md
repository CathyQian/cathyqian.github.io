Over the past five years, I've switched jobs a couple of times and thus have gained valuable experience in negotiating compensation with recruiters. While there are plenty of tutorials online about negotiating salary or pay, I'd like to share some personal insights and practical advice from both a big-picture and hands-on perspective.

### Big-Picture Strategies
#### Expect and Engage in Negotiations
When it comes to salary talks, employers actually anticipate it. It's natural to feel inclined to just accept what's offered, especially if you're from an Asian country or if you're a woman. However, in the context of Corporate America, things work differently. Businesses here operate in a competitive market, and job agreements are a two-way street. Both sides should come together, discuss terms, and find a solution that works best for everyone.

#### Negotiation Doesn't Jeopardize Offers
You might worry that negotiating could make the job offer disappear. But that's not usually the case. Employers have invested a lot in finding and interviewing you, so they're unlikely to back out easily.

#### Understand Your Leverage
Knowing your bargaining power is key. Having a counteroffer is great, but don't worry if you don't. Think about whether you're willing to decline the offer, even if it's your dream job. Remember haggling at the local store? It's a bit like that. You can decide to walk away if things don't align.

### Practical Approaches
#### Research Your Market Value
Before you start negotiations, it's smart to know how much others in similar roles are getting paid. Websites like levels.fyi are great for checking recent pay trends, especially in high-tech jobs.

#### Express Interest and Willingness
Let the employer know you're genuinely excited about the role and would be happy to join if compensation is agreed upon. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

#### Consider More Than Just Money
Show that you're thinking beyond the paycheck. This gives you flexibility to consider other factors and even decline if the offer doesn't meet your needs.

#### Let Them Make the First Move
It's better to let the recruiter propose a number first. This gives you an advantage and helps shape the conversation.

#### Request Time to Think
Don't rush. Ask for a few days to mull over the offer. Time is a powerful tool in negotiations. Recruiters worry you might get a better offer elsewhere, so they might sweeten the deal.

#### Know What's Negotiable
Understand what can be negotiated and what's fixed. Things that end up in your offer letter can usually be talked about, but discussing unwritten items isn't very effective. Base salary is often tough to change, but bonuses and stock options might have more wiggle room. Paid time off depends on the company.

#### Aim High, Be Flexible
When you come back with your counteroffer, aim higher but show you're willing to work towards a middle ground. This shows sincerity and provides space for compromise.

Negotiating job offers might seem daunting, but with the right approach, it's a chance for both sides to find common ground. Embrace the process, know your worth, and use these strategies to create a win-win scenario.
