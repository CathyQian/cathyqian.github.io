The year 2023 was a rollercoaster of emotions and experiences for me. It began with the intense demands of caring for a newborn and facing an unexpected layoff, yet it concluded with a tranquil two-week holiday with family.

I experienced one layoff. Shortly after Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, now known as X, I was laid off during parental leave, a challenging moment that coincided with my newborn passing his one-month milestone. This experience has strongly influenced my view of Mr. Musk and Tesla. I will probably never buy a Tesla car or Tesla stock in the future.

I got into one car accident. I accidentally bumped into our garage door, leading to costly repairs for both the door and the car. Fortunately nobody was hurt, but this promoted me to shift using public transportation and ride-sharing services for my weekly commute.

I engaged in two lawsuits â€“ the first against Twitter for an unresolved severance package, and the second with the Washington State Unemployment Department over a refund dispute. Ultimately, I chose to withdraw from both cases, recognizing the excessive time demands they placed on my life as a working parent.

I sent my son to daycare when he was only three and half months old. His early months were tough, with several cold and a Covid infection. At one point, we were so scared and called 9-1-1 at midnight. Thankfully, he has since adjusted well, growing into a robust and joyful toddler, excelling in both height and weight.

On a positive note, I secured a fantastic new role at a more prestigious company, complete with a superior compensation package. The work environment is supportive, and I genuinely enjoy my job. My son hasn't been sick at daycare after the initial two-month transition period, and has grown up into a healthy and happy toddler with both a 95% percentile height and weight. He is 13 months old now and can even feed himself. 

Reflecting on the year, I sometimes wish I had spent more time at home with my baby and been more patient with my daughter. However, I stand by the decisions I made. In an expensive city, balancing dual incomes is challenging, and many things are beyond our control. My current focus is on working towards early retirement, striving for a better future for my family.
