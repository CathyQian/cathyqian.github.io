As the holiday comes to an end, the new year begins to unfold. 2020 is a memorable year for most people,  difficult and full of twists and turns. However, no matter what, life is always full of hope.

假期即将结束，新的一年也慢慢拉开帷幕。
回首过去的一年，艰难而且充满波折。不过，无论如何，生活里总是充满希望。

The biggest changes in our family come from Luna, who has turned three this past November and made significant progress in many ways. For example, she has learned how to ride bycicle and scooter, how to cut papers and draw. The most exciting part is that she is no longer wearing diapers! In the past weeks, she has drawn animals on a couple of holiday cards and sent around to families and friends. In return, she has received holiday cards with animals for the first time in her life! Her stuffed doggy family has also grown from one to three -- Scout, Violet and Puqi. As an elder sister to all of the three, she would teach them lessons when they are not behaving and tell them stories when she is in good mood. 

变化最大的是妞妞，从两岁到三岁，方方面面进步很大。这一年里，妞妞学会了骑自行车和滑板车，剪纸和画画，也终于不再穿尿不湿了。节日里和爸爸妈妈一起寄出了好几张有她画画的卡片，也人生第一次收到了别人寄给她的卡片。家里又多了几个布偶狗弟弟狗妹妹，她也会以大姐姐自居教育这些淘气包们，心情好的时候会耐心地给他们讲故事。

I have switched to another department at Expedia Group, given that my former department was fully dissolved due to strategy adjustment of the company amid the pandemic. My new role will be focused on search ranking. Meanwhile, I have restarted blogging that has been interrupted for many years. Commuting time is running time now. Hope all these good habbits last long.

妈妈在公司里换了一个组，开始做搜索排序，同时也重拾了中断多年的博客爱好。另外，原来通勤的时间换成了健身和跑步，希望能坚持下去。

Andrew spent most of his 2020 strugging with rasing Series B funding for the start-up company he works at. Things started to get better last month, and hopefully they can close Series B fundraising successfully in 2021.

爸爸的2020在艰难地为公司融资中度过，现在终于有点眉目了，希望B轮今年能顺利完成。

In summary, our 2020 started with disappointment due to cancellation of our trip to China because of the pandemic, was spent mostly on both adults working at home with Luna playing around, and ended with tasty food especially yummy hotpot and egg tart made by daddy.

2020以回国探亲计划因疫情而中止的失望开始，以大人小孩都在家上班玩耍为主旋律，以爸爸做的美食尤其是火锅和蛋挞结束。

We sincerely hope the pandemic will end soon and all our life will be back to normal. We also wish all our families and friends a happy and prosperous 2021!

希望新的一年疫情早点结束，生活恢复正常。也祝各位亲朋好友新的一年喜乐安康!
