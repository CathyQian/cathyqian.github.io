I hold a STEM Ph.D. from the Univeristy of Pennsylvania by training and have done 10 years of cutting-edge fundamental research before transitioning to the tech industry. Please feel free to explore my legacy website [here](https://sites.google.com/site/zhaoxiaq/home/) for more information about my research projects and publications in academia.

I have spent the past five years mainly working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Twitter and a Machine Learning Scientist at Expedia. My skills encompass the entire spectrum of machine learning pipelines, from data extraction and preparation to exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training and deployment, as well as online experimentation and monitoring. I specialize in search and ads ranking.

Here are a couple of things I desire to do in the next five years:
- write a couple of technical books, sharing my knowledge and experiences with the broader community
- travel to a couple of Asian and European countries with my family, to create lasting memories
- join a company to work on products that bring people closer through technology
